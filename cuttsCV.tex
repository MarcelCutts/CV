\section{synopsis}

Full stack developer blended with client facing consultancy experience.

From stacking together a PC from salvaged parts to popular web applications, over the years I have absorbed technologies and systems making me a capable generalist. My thirst for learning endures, and I will continue to take knowledge hostage into the future. 

When not sat behind a computer for work or for fun, I mostly climb rocks, fight heavy people, trek across the arctic and play guitar talentlessly.

\newpage
\section{selection of relevant experience}
This section would normally contain a selection of experience relevant to a particular position, but as this edition will be public available on the web, I have included a varied assortment of projects below instead. 

\begin{projectentrylist}
%------------------------------------------------
\projectentry
{Data sandbox -  visualisation and analytical engines}
{\emph{JavaScript, Python, D3, HTML5/CSS3, Bottle, Jasmine, SqlLite, UX} \\
An academic institute is currently running a national birth cohort study investigating 100,000 people over a number of years. My role as an analyst and developer was to provide quantitative feedback which outlined the possible impact of study steering decisions. \\
Once I had begun to understand the domain and the needs of the various stakeholders, I created and refined software that allowed the institute to visually play with their data and parameters in real-time, receiving instant feedback on their potential decisions through detailed predictive metrics.\\
I created this system through a strong JavaScript front-end utilising D3 and other libraries, and python for numerical work on the back-end. This was achieved using a number of agile methodologies which I later expanded the use of within the study as a whole to help the institute adapt more rapidly to changing requirements. \\
Consequently, this gave the institute the power to not only quickly, but confidently make decisions in a time constrained field. As an additional bonus, due to the design efforts, it found a secondary purpose as presentation tool for displaying figures and scenarios externally.}

%------------------------------------------------
\projectentry
{Pharmaceutical portal}
{\emph{C\#, Python, MSSQL, Entity Framework, MVC4, nUnit, nSubstitute, WF, WCF, Unity, CI} \\
The portal offers a number of services providing speciality pharmaceuticals, including
a Global Access Program which is intended to provide unlicensed or trial-phase drugs
to patients in need, internationally and domestically.\\
A solution was required to handle
requesting, validation, procurement, shipping and tracking of these drugs by health care
professionals, via pharmaceutical suppliers, while fulfilling all necessary industry regulations. As the software gained clients, analytics and reporting were developed
to aid in overseeing the complex pharmaceutical chain. \\
A web-based application was created, by myself in a small scrum team, to satisfy these
requirements. We used an MVVM architecture built on .Netâ€™s MVC4 framework as the foundation and applied principles of agile, with rigorous unit testing and continuous integration testing throughout. \\
The result is a highly accessible portal for users and clients, which automated several previously manual processes. This allowed the client to rapidly expand
its program range with minimal additional effort.}
%------------------------------------------------

\projectentry
{Image analysis suite}
{\emph{Python, PIL, hardware hacking} \\
During my time at the department, a significant shift was going through the security printing industry which focused less on chemistry in inks and watermarks and looked more towards advanced optical effects as deterrents to counterfeiting. 
Due to the traditional nature of the company, no programming and few quantitative data systems or processes existed. I proposed and spear-headed an image analysis suite that could output several metrics on the goodness of produced products, as well as checking for the viability of various new technologies. Technologically, this was achieved through a combination of python programming and hardware hacking with available supplies. 
This created a brand new automated quality assurance process, which allowed products relying on tighter tolerances to be manufactured, and gave the research division previously unavailable insights. }
