\section{synopsis}

Full stack engineer with consultancy and business experience.

I am an exceptional generalist, having experienced a swath of different technologies and project types. I take an immense joy in building great software that positively impacts the world and am an outspoken advocate for good software and team practices.

When not behind a computer, I climb rocks, dive oceans, fight people, run, and play guitar talentlessly.
