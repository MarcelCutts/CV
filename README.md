CV
==

A LaTeX repository for storing my CV and its various editions in a source controlled fashion. Can be compiled with XeLaTeX, and requires Helvetica Neue fonts to be installed. If Helvetica is not available, I would heartily recommend Liberation Sans.

Based on the fantastic Friggeri template.
