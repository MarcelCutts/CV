### Tech and Roles CV
This version of the CV goes over the informal 2 page limit of CVs and expands on technologies used and roles held during each project at the request of a corporate entity.


### Summary
A LaTeX repository for storing my CV and its various editions in a source controlled fashion. Can be compiled with XeLaTeX, and requires Helvetica Neue fonts to be installed. If Helvetica is not available, I would heartily recommend Liberation Sans.

Based on the fantastic Friggeri template.
