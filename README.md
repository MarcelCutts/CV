CV

### C# CV version
This version of the CV aims to focus on C# and .Net skills that have been accumulated throughout the last couple of years.
### Summary
A LaTeX repository for storing my CV and its various editions in a source controlled fashion. Can be compiled with XeLaTeX, and requires Helvetica Neue fonts to be installed. If Helvetica is not available, I would heartily recommend Liberation Sans.

Based on the fantastic Friggeri template.
