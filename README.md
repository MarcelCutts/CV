### Tech and Roles CV
This version of the CV aims to focus on python skills throughout my career. I have resisted the urge to interlace the sound "Sssssss" into the content.

### Summary
A LaTeX repository for storing my CV and its various editions in a source controlled fashion. Can be compiled with XeLaTeX, and requires Helvetica Neue fonts to be installed. If Helvetica is not available, I would heartily recommend Liberation Sans.

Based on the fantastic Friggeri template.
